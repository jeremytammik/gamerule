one bridge bidding communication system according to patricia:

bidding x means y

1c --> 1d = 4+h
   --> 1h = 4+s
   --> 1s = 8-9 pts
   --> 1NT = 10-12 pts
1h or 1s --> 2c = 10-12 pts
   2c --> 2h or s = ... and a fit

this is just the rudimentary basis for a bidding system that she likes.

look it up, there are many systems, find one that fits.

The robots and the bidding are supposed to follow a system called:

Be warned, you get all kinds of bidding from human players and the robots (IMHO) lose the plot occasionally with their bidding/and or play!
