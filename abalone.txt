https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game)

Abalone is an award-winning two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent LÃ©vi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles[1] on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board.

The game is arranged similar to Chinese checkers but without starting spaces and with a "moat" around the edge of the board. Players start with 14 marbles instead of 10, there are only two "colors", and the starting arrangement is different. But the game also uses a hexagon with marbles and 5 pits on each edge.

The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take turns with the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either broadside / arrow-like (parallel to the line of marbles) or in-line / in a line (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.[2]

A player can push their opponent's marbles (a "sumito") that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board. The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent's marbles off of the edge of the board.[2] [3]

Abalone can be played by three or more people using the same board with fewer marbles for each player and each player has a different colour.[5][6]
